    <h1>Hi, I'm Mouad Elmellouki</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at the University of Virginia, minoring in Applied Mathematics. My passion lies in cybersecurity and threat detection. I have hands-on experience with penetration testing, digital forensics, reverse engineering, and incident response.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am proficient in Python and C++ for security scripting, familiar with tools like Wireshark, Metasploit, and Splunk, and I'm continuously expanding into malware analysis, threat intelligence, and secure system design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of cybersecurity, I love fitness and am a proud Buffalo Bills fan.
